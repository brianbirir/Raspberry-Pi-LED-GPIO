# Raspberry-Pi-LED-GPIO
A bash script that lights up three LEDs when executed on the Raspberry Pi compute module.

## Explaination
The code initiates the GPIO for pins 25, 26 and 27 and uses them as output via 1 (on) and 0 (off). A loop is present to light up the LEDs ten times on and off with a one secon delay.
